Perfect Array

Time Limit: 2 sec
Memory Limit: 128000 kB
Problem Statement
Given an array a of length n, tell us whether it has a non-empty subsequence such that the product of its elements is not a perfect square. A sequence b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by deleting some (possibly zero) elements.
Input
The first line of the input consists of an integer n denoting the length of the array a. The next line consists of n space- separated integers a1, a2, …, an denoting the elements of the array a.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ ai ≤ 104
Output
If there's a subsequence of a whose product isn't a perfect square, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No".

Example

Sample Input 1
3
1 5 4
Sample Output 1
Yes

Sample Input 2
2
100 10000
Sample Output 2
No
